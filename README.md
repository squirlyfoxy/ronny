# Ronny

Ronny is a A-DS (Api-Database Service). <br>
The goal of Ronny is to create an API based on the database the user defines.

## Ron
Ron is an interpretated language that is used to create the database (such as SQL but in a modern style). <br>
Ron implements:
-   A user-access system that allows the developer to decide what the end-user can access, modify and delete.
-   Functions!! No more JOINS, SUBQUERIES or anything like that. Call that like a REST call, and Ronny will do the rest!
